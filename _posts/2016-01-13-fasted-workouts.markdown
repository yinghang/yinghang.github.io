Growing up, I was always the nerdy little kid (still nerdy now, but less so) with glasses who rarely works out and has a "skinny fat" body. The sports that I used to "play" were some occasional basketball, running and chess (it is a sport!).

When I came to college, I gradually realize how fundamentally weak I was and how my "functional strength" were literally non-existent. I started hitting the weight room in my freshman year summer and I have come a long way since. I flirted with many different kind of programs (strength, hypertrophy, power) with varying degrees of success. With that being said, I have managed to successfully squat and deadlift more than my bodyweight, as well as put on a significant amount of muscle mass. 

Nevertheless, I have never been able to adopt an effective diet or reduce my body fat percentage to a satisfactory level while maintaining strength or muscle mass. I have always thought that one needs to go through the typical bulk/cut cycle to have an aesthetic physique. 

But, this was before I found out about [intermittent fasting](http://www.leangains.com/2010/04/leangains-guide.html/) (IF). IF allows you to cut down on your caloric intake, while burning a higher level of fat and still gain strength. The main idea is to fast for approximately 14-16 hours a day while have a "feeding" period of around 8 hours.

I have been practicing this method of training for quite a while and noticed its effectiveness, but I find that one of its requirements quite difficult to follow. IF suggests one to work out in a fasted state, and while this works for many people, I personally find it to be very challenging. I have tried working out while fasting for a few times, and I notice that I lose my strength dramatically and am usually in a "I-want-to-faint" state. 

Thus, I made a small change in the process myself, and I switched to lifting after breaking fast because I realized that it allows me to have enough energy to actually lift. The effectiveness of this entire program is still unclear but I will most definitely make an update on my progress down the road.
