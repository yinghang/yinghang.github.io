One of [WSJ headline articles](http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-economic-growth-slows-to-6-9-on-year-in-2015-1453169398) today:

> BEIJING—China recorded a pronounced deceleration in growth last year, affirming that a continued slowdown is biting the world’s second-largest economy harder with the downward grind expected to persist. 
> 
> The growth rate, released by the government on Tuesday, moderated to 6.8% for the fourth quarter and 6.9% for 2015. The annual pace was the weakest in a quarter century, and the quarterly level undershot market expectations, posting its lowest reading since the financial crisis and signaling weakening economic momentum.

Having studied economics in high school, I know that GDP growth is **”the”** number that people look at in order to measure the economic position/status/potential of a country. However, as Eminem said in his song “Lighters”, “cause what goes up, must come down”, it is pretty obvious that nothing can keep on going up.

For instance, a startup firm might be able to achieve tremendous and exponential growth (hundred or thousand percent) in its first few years, but it is never sustainable. The bigger one gets, the more one has to achieve in order to hit the same growth rate.

Hence the question, if everyone knows that nothing can keep on growing forever, why the sudden fear of declining growth? It is almost like a little kid being sad and starting to cry when his or her playtime is up. 

China has been posting incredulous growth rates since my middle school years and it has been almost 30+ years since China has opened up their economy. Personally, I’d say that it has been an extremely great run and the world should understand nothing goes on forever. Championship teams will age and gradually move out from the spotlight, and so will one country’s economy. Instead of chasing growth, some more realistic methods of quantification should be utilized to measure the improvement of the world’s economy.
