It is finally 2016! Sometimes, it shocks me how fast time flies. Events, friends, finals and relationships come and go. Barely a month ago, I was looking forward to enjoying the winter break with high school friends. But now, here I am, trying to reminisce the good times and ponder the answer to slowing down time. But I digress.

This post is about the new year, the new me that I want to transform into and the new habits that are going to help me along the way. I started blogging in 2007 but I have never been able to do it consistently. The process always starts with me being ecstatic about having a personal blog, making an interesting starter-post, and then slowing getting bored of writing. This negative habit can be well described using a favorite Chinese metaphor of mine, 虎頭蛇尾, or if you literally translate it, tiger's head and snake's tail. If you are interested to know more, this [site] {https://brandonzin.wordpress.com/2010/02/21/虎头蛇尾-tiger-head-snake-tail/} actually has a very good explanation of the metaphor.

Back to my new year "resolution", I personally think that blogging does help one's writing tremendously, and I have to admit that I have never been a great writer. Thus, I hope that it will be improved by my consistent blogging. As for what I am going to blog about, I think it is safe to say that it will cover a little bit of my life, current events that I find to be interesting, basketball (because who doesn't like basketball) and last but not least, tech and finance, because that is what I have always been interested in.

Till the next time!
